Anime Title,Reviewer,Review Text
Skip Beat!,sliceofpi,"If you've ever had someone betray you, or you are following your dreams, or you like slow-burn romance, this anime is for you! Yeah, kind of a weird combination, but this anime gives you both and it's AMAZING. It is such a relatable anime, but also inspiring, and I think everyone could get something from it. 

I also never really read manga, I've only read RELIFE because the anime was so good and I just had to read it. But this anime was so good that I feel I have to read the manga, so that says something!

Story - 9
The story is really engaging and
                  ...
has so many fun plot points. I really loved seeing Mogami keep fighting again and again to get a step further in the acting industry. However, I give a 9 because I did think the music video arc was a bit too slow and drawn out, especially since we didn't see much of the other characters during that arc, and I missed them. However, overall, great job at being interesting, and slow enough to sustain realistic character development, but not to bore you.

The romance is also done exceptionally well. It is a slow burn, but that makes it feel more real. But... I do think they should have made Mogami a bit older, it wouldn't have really changed the story. There is some... weird talk about the age gap between her and another man in one of the episodes, and it all could have been avoided if they just made her 18. 

Art - 10
I love the art style. It is never really lazy, and the scenes are just so fun to watch. It is bright, lively, and vivid, without paining your eyes or looking childish.

Sound - 9
I LOVE the first opening, and love the second opening even more. The first opening gets you hyped up but still has a motivational vibe, while the second is more serious and gentle but I love it so much. The endings are both okay to me. Also, I watched the English dub, and they actually dubbed the openings and endings as well, so I am referring to the dubbed versions of them. I listened to the subbed versions as well, but I actually like the voices of the English dub better so I would recommend listening to those once even if you watch sub. 

The general soundtrack is very good. There is a wide variety of pieces. There are many relaxing pieces you could listen to to study. 

Characters - 10
This anime does characters so well. I generally like the entire cast, even though the guy who betrays the main character at the beginning is a genuinely bad guy, they still put thought into him to make him a character that isn't just a cardboard cutout and I appreciate that. I LOVE Kyoko! She is such a fun main character and her anger is so relatable. I really like Ren, he is such a sweet guy, and I like the rest of the cast too. The characters all have their flaws, but are still loveable and have great personalities. There is also amazing character development seen through the characters, the realistic type that is slow and not all of a sudden. 

Enjoyment - 10
This anime is just so fun to watch, AND it has a great underlying message/tone. You are watching this girl chase after her dreams, even when everybody tells her to quit. She is truly inspiring. But she is also so relatable in her struggles and thoughts and emotions. 

Overall - 9
I honestly might change this to a 10 in the future. I just love this anime so much! I think just about everyone would enjoy this, because we all feel anger at times, and watching Mogami unleash her anger is so enjoyable. Also, it's always good to watch someone follow their dreams so you remember you can too :)"
Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun,CaptainKenshiro,"This ova is dumb as fuck, and I know that’s a strong and harsh way to begin a review but I find no other nor more appropriate way to sum it up. The premise has a woman paying a private investigator to find her criminal husband to see him one last time, it’s sentimental but also kind of cheesy from the get go. At least the pacing is not bad, since even though the protagonist is seemingly fooling around, he is getting close to people related to his target and gathering information about him, that way he also comes to learn stuff about him, and
                  ...
since every character he encounters is related to the man he is searching, both that guy and everyone else gets fleshed out at the same time by revealing more about their shared backdrops each time. The movie it’s mostly about that, there isn’t much plot in it aside from showing the lives of the criminal and his acquaintances. 

Visually the anime is good for a single minor production from its time, character designs are simple and generic, the artwork suffer from some quality drops, and motions are simple and not very good. Backgrounds and special effects, however, elevate the overall visuals. The sound is very forgettable and unnoticeable, weak sound effects, weak music, very average voice acting. 

The main problem of this title is presenting a fake grey morality, it tries to judge the horrible actions of the man everyone is searching from a moral standpoint, and what they do with him at the end feels satisfactory because both his wife and friend take a big part on it, but it also tries its hardest to justify every single thing he does. Exploring a character to understand his motivations is one thing, justifying the horrible things he does is another completely different. Not only that but the conflict could have been resolved much sooner if every single person here didn’t act so stupidly and illogically. Also the anime becomes idiotically melodramatic at the end by attempting to present a situation as complex when it’s not, it’s very simple as the outcome comes to prove. Finally, the closure it tries to give to its story and bad guy was so corny and out of place, the movie tries to say that he found forgiveness, redemption and a sweet, touching and emotional reunion but it fucking isn’t possible to buy it, he was a horrible person through and through and his train of thoughts was completely irrational and only gave an even worse impression of him, he didn’t deserve any happy ending, and certainly not one where he happily reunites with his first victim. 

This is supposed to be the adaptation of just one case, the 170th, of a long manga, in turn spin-off of an ever going way bigger manga franchise, which is why there is no context given about the protagonist nor any of his coworkers, plus, if this is its level of quality, then there’s no reason to delve into it. Despite being a short watch, it is still a waste of time."
Zankyou no Terror,10h,"dogshit. horrible. rather eat shit than watch this again.

Chainsaw Man,krispygabu,"The anime adaptation of Chainsaw Man may differ from its manga counterpart, but it certainly does not disappoint. While the manga keeps you on your toes , the anime allows you to savor every moment of this darker shounen storyline.

Animation quality is unparalleled, from meticulously crafted fight scenes to even the most minute details like a toothbrush. Lighting is particularly noteworthy, creating an incredible visual atmosphere. Unlike many anime that resort to ""cute and comedic"" scenes *cough* demon slayer *cough* to cut corners, Chainsaw Man takes itself seriously. The result is a truly cinematic experience.

Every OP and ED was different and visuals for all of
                  ...
them were unique. Really enjoyed this , felt like Bakemonogatari in this sense.

Most of the artists that made the music for Chainsaw Man are well known(KY,Aimer,Eve,Syudou,Vaundy,TK,Kensuke Ushio) , ones who I had been following for years. It really impressed me that they were able to get all these artists involved in the production.

The setting sets it apart from other shounen series. No cliché trope of relying on the power of friendship to overcome all obstacles. Of course, like many other shounen , there is the inclusion of a clueless and unrealistically stoic protagonist. Fortunately , this choice was fitting. It injected humor into dark scenes, diffusing tension and offering a refreshing balance to the narrative."
Arabian Night: Sindbad no Bouken,LAPOdes,"- Português
O filme inteiro é muito confuso, tem coisas que não ficam claras e quebras de roteiro. Os personagens são desinteressantes e não são bem construídos. A história é bem clichê e muito esquecível, única coisa que impede eu de dar uma nota menor que quatro é a animação, que é aceitável para os padrões da época.
- English
The entire movie is very confusing, the are things that are not clarified and script broking. The characters uninteresting and are not well developed. The history is quite cliché and very forgettable, the only thing that prevents me for give it a lower four note it's the animation,
                  ...
that are ok for the time."
Gosenzo-sama Banbanzai!,DISKOWN,"Gosenzo-sama Banbanzai! heavily relies on its comedic appeal to engage viewers, featuring limited animation and heavy amounts of dialogue that is more akin to a screenplay than a typical anime. The series executes its animated segments well and features character designs that complement the overall tone. However, viewers who do not find the humor to their liking may not find much else to enjoy. Gosenzo-sama Banbanzai! caters specifically to a particular audience, and those who do not fit that demographic may want to explore other options. Ultimately, the series will likely be well-received by its target audience, but may leave others scratching their heads."
"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri",Benx2019,"Good animation overall, although rather plain. The action scenes look pretty good, but not crazy flashy. Backgrounds are fine to good in quality, and while not always the case, generally the character detail is good as well. The characters are fine, they're fairly likeable, but lack any significant amount of depth. The story is very good, strong plot, decent world building. The story is very fleshed out, but the pacing is just okay. It's a little slow from time to time, and there really isn't enough tension in my opinion. The voice acting is good, decent casting, good enough performances, but then again not terribly
                  ...
impressive either. Solid soundtrack, and a decent op/ed. Overall it's a fairly well put together anime, but the characters and pacing are somewhat lacking. It's good, but doesn't grab the viewer in the way I feel it could. 7.00/10"
High School DxD BorN,Toh-ka,"Simply the best season of DxD, seeing everyone maturing made me happy but I was impressed by how Issei matured, he's the character who needed it the most and oh boy how he was done properly, the writing is clearly much better than the first two seasons.
Only thing I have to complain about is the animation, it has it's weaknesses and I really hope that if there's no season 5 in the works, at least they'll be remade, I am watching the Blu-Ray version but the animation is still pretty bad sometimes, so hopefully it will someday get a remake with much better animation, that's
                  ...
the only thing I can honestly complain about for this third season of Highschool DxD."
Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu,CyberXane,"New season new problems, but unlike other anime this one is a bit interesting. It's going over the Rudeus' depression from what he thinks was a break up with Eris. He's been scarred so much that he is now impotent whenever it comes to anything with women. Having actually read the manga I felt the story doesn't really get much more developed for world building this season, but some interesting things do happen at times. You could say this season's journey is about learning how to get over the girl he once loved, building a reputation for himself, and making new friends, but nothing world
                  ...
changing or story heavy. Though plenty of character development.

I'm surprised with how the story was playing out it made it more entertaining than I thought in the anime. The animation was definitely solid. Overall It's definitely feels like a downgrade from the previous seasons, but it's alright, and still good. 7/10"
ChroNoiR Episode.0,namaewananikana,"The Art style and quality are quite great. The story telling/portrayal was definitely awesome. The fight scene was wonderfully drawn and animated.

The characters are remarkably visually appealing or gorgeous like their story. The encounter, and friendship is so simple and yet gut-wrenching. The straightforwardness of the characters leaves a deep impression. It was very poetic in a way.

A short animation with all the visuals and that song complements the elements of the story itself. The story itself is how this becomes a treasure, a hidden gem, the mystery, the journey/adventure and fateful encounters. 

The story itself is unique in its own way, and it ended
                  ...
being so much more than expected."
Kimetsu no Yaiba,Mitteh,"It's not even close to top tier animes like aot, naruto, death note. Totally doesn't deserve its hype. Characters are annoying most of the time, battle scenes are awful, because you don't even understand what is happening, angle changes many times during the fight so it""s horrible. People say it has the best animation over the other ones, i personally don't think so, but even if they right the beautiful animation doesn't do its job when you can't show the whole fight properly. So it pointless to have multi colorful image and show either ultra close view or mess of paints. The biggest advantage of
                  ...
the anime is its weakness."
Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san Movie,TRYHANAEL,"I had to talk about this anime. Each season has all been superb, and gave me joy and a certain nostalgia. 
To talk about the film, the music, the sets, the voices, the ambiance/atmosphere, seeing Nishikata and Takagi again what a pleasure... nothing could make me happier :) 
Huge W the studio doing very good things (with Dangers in my heart recently) 
This anime is one of my favorite romances with Kaguya Sama and Oregairu, but it has a special place that makes me soothed and admiring when I watch it, great movie! ❤️
If u like romance go check it !
(I'm sorry for the bad
                  ...
english guys)"
Boukensha: The Man Was from Spain,passing_through,"I wasn't expecting much when I stumbled upon this anime, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it is. I know the man himself is a controversial figure, and rightly so for starting the series of inquisitions of the natives on the western hemisphere, but while the humanization is a bit weird and propaganda-like, I think it successfully does its job at building character, at least while he's still young. It honestly gives me nostalgia for Liberty's Kids, and the at-times awkward dubbing makes the show pretty funny (I'd like to know who voiced young Columbus). The music is also really catchy, especially the theme
                  ...
song. Reminds me of old shows from the fifties and sixties. Honestly, if my history teachers found this growing up I would have watched a couple episodes of this alongside Liberty's Kids. I've also learned quite a bit about Columbus himself that I'd never learned from school, like how he grew up in a region of Italy called Genoa (I thought he grew up in Portugal), and that the cross that's now known as England's official flag was officially theirs (England stole it because of course they did).

Overall the anime itself is objectively fine, the main criticism I have is that it's 26 episodes, so eventually it's going to get pretty boring. I think the show should have been ten or twelve episodes instead. However, I would recommend this for the entertainment value it has, especially the first three episodes I've seen. Give it a watch, see if you like it :)"
Detroit Metal City,MeanEYE,"Very solid entertainment. I wish they've made episodes a bit longer but not because I wanted more content rather dialogs were sometimes really hard to follow. It's 12 episodes of well animated comical nonsense. Every episode had something that made mi giggle and that's something. Usually japanese humor flies above my head unmistakably. This time jokes actually land and are funny.

Our main character is the only one which is somewhat developed. It's kind of hard focusing more on character writing when episodes are 10 or so minutes long so I'll give them a pass on that. That said his duality, or rather split personality disorder
                  ...
by the looks of it, is a well chosen stage for this kind of absurd comedy.

Animation was actually not bad. I think the choice to go for comic book like panels in combination with contrast between cartoonish look for sane parts and gritty for metal parts is a good one. My only regret is that there's not more music. Few scores that are in this show are actually really good, apart from lyrics of course. :)

I'd say this one is worth a watch. It's a silly comedy that doesn't overstay its welcome and provides good entertainment."
5-toubun no Hanayome Movie,Nitro_Mathias,"This movie, Was More gonna be the season 3 of 5-toubun no Hanayome, they made a movie instead.

Where the movie turned out great, If you have watched as far as this, Just so you know, this movie gets very emotional

It's a 2 hour movie which can feel very harsh to through for some people, when your first invested in this movie you will mostly like see the whole thing

As the series itself (season 1 and 2) It has the moments where your gonna either almost cry and moments where your gonna laugh a little where it has a very good balance in some ways.

The movie
                  ...
goes a little more down on the comedy side of the series and spike heavely up on emotions where you constantly can feel the tension of what's happening in the movie.

As i said in my review of 5-toubun no Hanayome, if you like romcom's this is deffinently something for you

Give it a watch it 100 procent worth it. But watch the season 1 and 2 first because as i said, this is more or less the season 3 of the this awesome series"
5-toubun no Hanayome ∬,Nitro_Mathias,"The whole series for me Was really fun and was really good at keeping me watching

If you expect alot of just hilarious stuff then get ready because this is a whole ride in it self
This Anime has all sorts of moments in it where the watcher gets to feel all sorts of emotions

this Anime is Really good for People who like Romcom's this is more or less Your typical Romcom where you have the moments where you laugh alot and moments where you are close to crying 

If you like Romcom's this will deffinently be something for you, this Anime, can get you Emersed in
                  ...
it instantly from episode one

If you think Episode is kinda Meh Just you Wait and see for yourself, this is a really good anime, Give it a good watch

Ones you start on it, you just dont wanna stop watching"
K-On!,Skillover,"Final Verdict: MID
This show was Horrid. I could barely watch this. the music is so bad and the voice acting is worse than EXARM and made me almost throw up on a multitude of occasions. I made this account purely to voice my displeasure with this show this was hype up to be "" an alright show"" but all a got was a poorly paced disaster of a story with about as much charm as forespoken on launch. the art style is okay at best and the only thing saving this show what's so ever. I wasted my time with this mess and dont get
                  ...
me started on the characters they are all one dimensional copypastes








if you like having fun with a show. k-on is not for you"
Dr. Stone: New World,ozhbz,"Dr stone from 10/10 to 7/10
Second season was a downgrade but still very good, special movie was great and add a new interesting character but this season? huge downgrade. They added a disgusting unnecessary trap character with hidden gender, i really don't understand why this cringe character exist, big turn off and the serie becomes uncomfortable to watch.
Soundtrack, voice acting and vibes are still peak but the story? mid writing with this arc and what the fuck is that character that appear from nowhere? really stupid plot decisions, even that beam idea was stupid just keep the mystery. Inventions and science parts got skipped and
                  ...
nerfed too much, no explanations anymore, they just make things from nowhere."
Vinland Saga Season 2,ozhbz,"This is a Masterpiece.
Season 1 becomes great after the first half, this Season 2 is great since the first episode, the quality is insane.

Best anime of the season and one of the best of the year. 

Excellent character development, worldbuilding, storytelling,
writing, characters

Everything from the original source material is elevated by studio Mappa with their incredible Direction, Animations, Art and Soundtrack. This anime is a pleasure to watch. 

I had low expectations for this season after the death of the character that stole the show, but i was wrong and i understood that since the first episode"
Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Movie,honzoslav,"Not much to say here. It's exactly what's on the tin. That being said, it never reaches the same heights as the first season. The pacing was a bit off and the first half could most definitely be ten or maybe even fifteen minutes shorter. There is also a fake out death, but since this is a prequel and the character still lives in the main series, they aren't fooling anyone. They also try to have this emotional moment when revealing Maki's backstory, but once again, I already know about it since I watched the first season. Look at this point, I am just nitpicking.
                  ...
My main point is that even though its more of the same, it just doesnt hit as hard as the first season did. Its still very good but its missing something to be excellent. I guess I was just expecting another Mugen Train and it's not that."
Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero,Bensonas,"First of all, ill give some context to my love of Dragon Ball. I can say this confidently, and I would put money on it that most UK people on here, who are early 30s, wouldnt be on this site without a littlle channel called Cartoon Network and a little show called Dragon Ball Z. So many days spent rushing home from primary school to 'tune in next time on Dragon Ball Z, being 9 or 10, seeing Goku winding up the spirit bomb and watching him unleash it when i was 19.... I joke. 

Untimately, im a massive fan of Dragon Ball. Even GT
                  ...
has great moments as far as im concerned, thank god super happened ill be honest, but still, GT had its moments. Lookong back not too far is, what feels like it anyway, tHE 1000000000th film with Broly it. However, it re wrote the source of Broly's hatred, made it cannon and god damn was it great. Sublime animation, no messing about with trying too much of a story and provided us with another moment to add to the pile of the incredibly exciting moments Dragon Ball has given us over so many years.  So with the weight of the above behind me, I proudly press play on Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.

So......here we go.......this film is absolute garbage.  I cannot even begin to convey my dissapoint at literally every aspect of this film. Firstly, lets mention its redeeming qualities....it's not very long.

Right then, now thats done, animation wise, I have no idea what the hell the studio was thinking. I have seen better character animation on Sega arcade cabinates in the late 90s. Scratch that. Ive seen better animation on the LCD screens when I went bowling.  Some may say, 'well thats a massive exaggeration' I know, but im annoyed. Ill leave it with this, if you are able to sit through this, without a confused look on your face, wondering how it all went so wrong, you are a better person than me.

The story just drags, laboriously so. I get it, we can't just keep following Goku and Vegeta getting stronger and stronger for ever more, well...maybe we could, but character depth is key. So having a film dedicated to Gohan and Piccolo was welcomed. But my God was it wasted. We are done with the Red Ribbon Army guys, completely done. But not only do they return, we get a terrible rehash of another villain. A villian no less that gave us one of the best saga DB has to offer, one of the greatest fights with Goku that is so underrated and instilled genuine fear as a child watching. It was the laziest villian recall I have ever seen, and ive seen Mob season 3. Final thing ill say on the story, we get treated to some new things from Piccolo and Gohan. Piccolo's is the laziest writing ive ever seen for a character in DB and Gohan's is a wasted opportunity. Personally, this should have waited until Super returning to our screens as the manga, so ive read anyway, explains it better.

Ill end with this, as I feel like I might have lost my mind writing this.  It was honestly the single most disappointing anime ive watch. There so much hype about it yet i saw no justification for it. Its certainly not the worst DB Film, but its among them and that is a deep pile of crap to be a part of."
The First Slam Dunk,IAmWaterLaw,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, a wave of disappointment came over me as it looks so different from the anime and the obvious use of CG for the film. However, I still decided to go see the movie even with some doubts and have to say it blew me away. Even knowing the outcome of the film, I was still on the edge of my seat especially during to last 20 minutes of the film, which is animated amazing. The music is also surprisingly good, and really fits with the tone. The new protagonist was a bit off putting as Sakuragi
                  ...
is in my opinion much more interesting, however the film does a good job at making Miyagi feel more alive than ever, and Sakuragi still gets many good moments throughout the film. Overall its amazing, and I loved every second of it!"
Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu,Kushagra800,"Its a good romantic series and i think you wont get bored or anything.it has fantastic storyline and it will keep you interesting.
Hope to see the second season soon.....
Well it was not unique i know that there are others like this plot but its also true that some differences that this story have will make you watch it till the end.
Characters are just good.what i am trying to say is that characterization is not the strong suit of this anime because the specially feeble characters are strong in this anime so good luck.the art style is just good according to me."
Mousou Dairinin,CaptainKenshiro,"Why do I do this? I recently covered Ghost Hound, a title I found very hard to review, and here I am writing about Paranoia Agent, an anime that I find even harder to talk about. Sigh

Mousou Dairinin is a series that works way more on a conceptual level than at its execution, and it’s also the definition of a series for an acquired taste, as its writing is not very good for the hardest to please most critical viewers, and its narrative is almost unapproachable for a casual audience that just wants to have a good time. Also, being a work with Satoshi Kon
                  ...
in it raises the expectation high in terms of directing and atmosphere, and only one of them is truly achieved in this series. It doesn’t help that this is a show that’s best to watch after you already watched all the movies from the director first to get used to his style for a single, rather short entry before jumping to a full series. 

Let’s start with the easiest part which is the animation as a whole, easily one of the best you’ll find in any anime series, not a single quality drop as far as I’m concerned, very well made backgrounds, expressive and detailed motions, great special effects, great use of lightning and shading, great changes from brighter to darker colors whenever needed, and at times different art styles are well integrated within the series both visually and narratively. Plus it has the usual exceptional directing that can be expected from Satoshi Kon, just as he did with his movies before this series, he really captured how distorted the characters perceive reality by either messing up the visuals completely with added first person perspectives, or with a quick succession of scenes transitioning into one another. The only complaint I have here are the designs, which feel derivative from any other work from the director, they are not bad, I appreciate how realistic and varied the character figures are, but they definitely give the idea of being rehashed from somewhere else.

The sound is good but not amazing, and that’s the exact same thing that can be said about each part of the whole department. Voice acting? Good but not among the best you’ll find in the medium. Sound effects? Same thing. Music? Same thing, again, especially coming from Susumu Hirasawa. The opening is weirdly catchy, as it should, the visuals give you the idea that every character is uncontrollably laughing while losing their minds, thus it transmits the idea of paranoia quite well, and the song sounds uncomfortably upbeat for its super weird lyrics, for what’s being displayed on screen, and for the show it’s used for. The ending is simple and repetitive yet it also gives you the feeling of something that’s cute and relaxing at first approach, yet it hides something sinister underneath, while every important character peacefully sleeps around the main mascot of both the series and the world it takes place in, very fitting with the overall feel and themes of the anime, I’d say. With that said, there is a very well made sound mixing in here, especially during the darker and more intense and suspenseful moments, too bad the whole show isn’t like that.

But what is it about? A kid with a bat hitting people in the head, changing his targets on every episode. What feels like a simple episodic series at first, ends up being an interconnected psychological thriller, as every victim is related to a previous one, and there are two police detectives interrogating them and searching for clues to get to the bottom of the mystery and incidents. That’s not all, as every character gets an episode dedicated to showcase their lives and all the mental pressure they go through and the dark secrets they are hiding. Even though some are more important to the answer to the mystery than others, this approach makes every single one of them serviceable as plot devices and fleshed out on a basic level. There’s more though, as every character has technology and gossips/rumors making their lives harder on one way or another, which along with their subsequently more fragile psychological stability, ends up making them have suicidal thoughts, as means to escape from reality and the difficulties they face on a daily basis.

And that’s basically the core idea behind the show, to explore Japan's mentally stressed and overwhelmed, overworked and suicidal society, and how lies and fake news propagate with ease and can ruin lives or at least makes them harder. It also shows how said society deals with that through escapism, through both its use of technology and consumerism, of the cute main mascot from and within the show, as well as just ending it all as a mean to avoid dealing with the struggles and responsibilities one might have. Something very important to talk about for the time it came out at the beginning of the 21st century, that’s perhaps even more relevant now.

I’d like to show this with a quick description of several episodes, without spoilers:

-Episode 1. The first woman and first victim, one of the most important characters in the show, designer of the main mascot from and within the series, hated by her coworkers and pressured to come out with an equally or even more successful successor to the pink dog she popularized. Being the first person to be attacked, she is questioned a lot about the incident and even suspected of making up the whole story, both on her work, by the detectives, and on social media.

-Episode 2. The first kid and third victim, a narcissistic piece of shit suspected and rumored of being the teen with the bat, falsely accused of being a bully and later on being bullied himself, through a photo of him that’s shared on the cell phones of everyone at his school.

-Episode 3. The second woman and fifth victim, private tutor of the previous kid, a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder, and a prostitute at night. Both personalities try to overcome the other and talk to each other through her phone. This is the best and most Satoshi Kon episode on this Satoshi Kon series.

-Episode 4. The second man and sixth victim, a policeman extorted to work for the mafia to protect his family, under an alias of sorts, he uses a weird mask and stuff, and his personality changes a lot while doing it so. This is quite of a subversive episode of sorts, as the outcome wasn’t like the usual of the previous episodes, and the series dares to take a path that is seemingly going to end the plot in less than half the duration of the show, an interesting but risky move. Also there doesn’t seem to be any implication of technology here.

-Episode 5. I could bet this was one of the most hated and frustrating episodes to watch as it was airing, since the tone is completely different from the rest of the show, thus it comes off as extremely bizarre in an already uncommon series. It is about a kid who sees the whole world as Dragon Quest, while also a parody of sorts of said franchise. Nothing else can be said about it without spoiling a big part of the anime.

-Episode 6. The first girl and seventh victim, who communicates with her father through her cellphone, and she learns that he uses cameras to spy on her. It is directly linked with the fourth episode and adds the technological aspect that said episode was missing. It also flips the whole case up until this point. 

-Episode 7. One of the detectives is starting to be affected and becomes paranoiac himself, as he keeps listening to the testimonies and searching for clues on his own, he starts hallucinating because of the static of all the radios he uses for that.

-Episode 10. The fourth man and eight victim, out of the ones shown on screen, as at this point the conflict reaches a much bigger scale than what it’s actually shown on screen. This asshole keeps fucking up the anime of the mascot and blaming everyone else, the connections with technology are many to name, but is the one that has the most distorted view of reality, he does so many horrible things that are shown as quick flashbacks as he is falling asleep while driving. Probably narcoleptic. The episode is also a somewhat self-satire of anime production.

-Episodes 11 to 13. Yeah no, as if I were to talk about the episodes that give the answers and closure to the whole show, as well as a catharsis for some characters.

As you may notice, I didn’t talk about episodes 8 and 9, and that’s where the first problem of this anime lies, since those episodes felt like filler. The first has three online suicide friends, something that apparently exists in Japan and the Dark Web. It makes you think that it’s going to be important but it’s mostly comical in a twisted way and it tries to fool the audience that the criminal is a paranormal force, it’s not, it’s something even crazier. The second is just some women telling some made up stories about the kid with the bat, it’s meant to show the level of gossiping and paranoia up until that point but the rest of the episodes do the same with much better execution and results. These two could easily be skipped without losing much, the characters don’t even appear in the opening and ending like the rest of them, and it makes it feel like the series has an issue in its pacing and amount of episodes. 

The second issue is how the anti-suicide and anti-escapism message and answer for the mystery are directly told to the audience with no subtlety, different from the works of the director so far, I’m guessing because he wasn’t on charge of the script.

The third problem lies on the message itself, which is very simplistic and will feel misguided to most western viewers, of which I’m one of. As was discussed on several episodic discussions of this series that I’ve read on different sites, particularly on its eight episode, it’s important to understand that suicide is seen in a different way on the Japanese society and culture. Whereas in the West is commonly thought of as an act of selfishness and cowardice that should be avoided and persuaded from, over there it’s conceived as a way to pay for all the failures in your life, that nobody else should be sticking their noses in, so it’s the not very different but also the ultimate way of handling them, by giving your life on a last failure, basically.

And since Paranoia Agent is a Japanese series made by Japanese people, its message and criticism are not directed towards the problem itself, but the individual, as expected. Let me explain, the anime shows many different harsh scenarios and situations of many different people, and instead of seeing it as a collective problem, it still keeps the blame on every individual, it’s weird that it sees many different sources for what’s a common issue, while somewhat connecting every singular conflict, yet it ultimately concludes and decides that the problem is within each person as an isolated case. This means that the message of the show ends up being: “yeah, we know there are many issues within our society, you might suffer from some of them yourself, but you just have to tough it up and face them”, which is not exactly bad, but it isn’t very different from telling a depressed person to just cheer up or an addict to just stop consuming whatever they are addicted to, it’s a good but very simplistic and reductionist and not very empathetic message. It exposes a problem but it does not offer a very critical response to said issue, though I guess it’s expected for its era and I guess it would probably be presented differently nowadays.

The fourth issue are the characters, which although greatly used narratively as great plot devices that are even fleshed out on a basic level, all they have is a backdrop story, no one is very memorable nor have much personality outside their mental issues, and no one has a development, also only the most important ones have something that can be considered a catharsis, and even then one of them just seemed to have become totally delusional and repeats the cycle of another character, whose actions are completely incomprehensible, in a seemingly circular manner. The rest are shown again at one point in the series, thus you get to see what happened to them, but since the events in-between are missing, you don’t get to see how they ended like that, making their struggles and their respective solutions easier and simpler than they were previously presented.

The fifth problem is that it’s meant to be an allegorical series, instead of seeing it as something that it’s actually happening.  There’s nothing strictly bad with using symbolisms, especially when they actually mean something instead of being just cool or artsy visuals, but this way the writing comes off as totally unrealistic and nonsensical if seen in a literal manner, almost supernatural or fantastical in a setting that’s otherwise perfectly normal and mundane. Also, this way some of its biggest events come off as uneventful and easily fixable, those storms that take place in the show? Don’t worry, they don’t actually happen and everything is back to normal in the end. 

It’s even harder to accept because of the way the series is presented, reality is often twisted as a result of someone’s state of mind in the works of Satoshi Kon, but in almost every one of those, the characters are limited to a small set, often even just one of them, In Perfect Blue, it’s because of the protagonist slowly losing her sanity because of the fear and the pressure, her famous persona and the different image of her that she shows publicly giving her an identity crisis. In Millennium Actress, it comes in the form of the fading and blurry memories of a senile old woman who was also an actress, so her recollections of her life mix in her head with the movies and roles she played. In Tokyo Godfathers, the main homeless trio lies to themselves and others when they talk about how their lives turned that way, and how responsible they are for that. Paranoia Agent plays out in a similar way, but with a much bigger scope and an approach and reasoning that doesn’t feel as close, human and personal as his previous works, as it also partially makes the struggles to be quite external instead of entirely or mostly internal. Unfortunately he would do something similar with his last work Paprika, as dreams and reality blur with each other, only to be solved with an asspulled power up and everything going back to normal like nothing happened.

Bottom line, Paranoia Agent presents some of the best concepts and themes ever in anime with neat visuals and directing, serviceable atmosphere and a great use of interconnected plot devices to deliver an ok although weirdly presented and delivered message, but the writing and characterization are almost an afterthought for that, in a series that feels slow and very hard to digest and accept. I consider it to be worse than Tokyo Godfathers but better than Paprika. Worthy as a complementary one time watch to Satoshi Kon's previous movies, but not much else.

"Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san",f2k8,"""Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san"" provavelmente é um título que te trás muitas memórias - sejam elas boas ou ruins - visto que foi um dos principais animes a serem lançados durante a pandemia. Sob essa ótica, o enredo da série gira em torno do romance entre um garoto antissocial chamado Naoto Hachiouji e uma garota chamada Hayase Nagatoro, uma jovem que usa a introversão de Naoto para fazer provocações, as quais são o fator de comédia da obra. Ao decorrer do anime, porém, percebemos que Nagatoro começa a nutrir sentimentos pelo seu ""senpai"", como ela o chama, e suas provocações começam a ter um teor de flerte,
                  ...
constituindo uma estrutura de enredo padrão para uma comédia romântica.

Por mais que o enredo em si aparente ser interessante, Nagatoro falha em sua execução. O protagonista possui zero experiência amorosa (e zero desenvolvimento da mesma ao decorrer da série) e sempre responde de forma embaraçosa aos avanços da Nagatoro, que também é uma personagem rasa, cujo único traço de personalidade é provocar o Naoto. Os personagens secundários também são rasos e irritantes, principalmente as amigas da Nagatoro, que são praticamente clones dela e fazem o mesmo papel que a Nagatoro, como se elas não tivessem personalidade própria. O humor se torna enjoativo rápido, pois todas as piadas são praticamente iguais, consistindo das mesmas provocações da Nagatoro sendo recicladas de novo e de novo em contextos levemente diferentes. Além disso, o ""romance"" não progride: o relacionamento entre os dois personagens principais quase não muda, tendo um pouco de progresso no começo mas se estagnando do meio ao fim. Podemos descrever Nagatoro como uma comédia romântica sem comédia ou romance. Apesar de tudo isso, o anime ainda possui seus momentos bons, com cenas fofas entre o protagonista e a deuteragonista, onde o espectador começa a acreditar que o relacionamento entre os dois irá progredir. Entretanto, essa esperança é prontamente destruída na próxima cena, onde a relação regride para onde ela estava antes e a cena anteriormente mencionada perde todo o seu sentido.

Em suma, ""Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san"" é uma comédia romântica genérica que reusa as mesmas piadas durante toda a sua duração, não tentando sair de sua zona de conforto e inovar em nenhum momento. Além do que foi citado anteriormente, outra coisa que separa a obra de comédias românticas bem-sucedidas, ao exemplo de Kaguya-sama, é a unidimensionalidade dos personagens - que, em sua maioria, possuem apenas um traço de personalidade, servindo apenas para progredir a repetitiva ""história"" do anime. Se você gostar de comédias românticas bobas e repetitivas, que mantêm uma estrutura fixa e previsível do começo ao fim e têm medo de inovar, dê uma chance a Nagatoro, caso contrário, você estará perdendo seu tempo."
Tengoku Daimakyou,ZalMohr,"A Promised Neverland outside and inside POV anime? kinda. 
but honestly this show was great from start to finish, episode 8 being the best episode that makes you instantly fall in love with a character they just introduced.

The way both perspectives were shown and narrated was interesting. They both gave hints about what's really happening, and it makes you think about how those hints can be connected.

This show would have been a 10/10 if not for the random groping scenes and Maru going for kisses 24/7.
Overall i think this is a show most people will find very enjoyable, so it's worth the watch!"
Kidou Senshi Gundam,Wander42314,"as it happens to be one of the most famous animes i knew i had to check this one out and lemme tell you this lived up to the hype. the highs were some of the best anime ive seen yet. yet the lows were quite low.
the story is quite simple yet interesting in how its done, a war between the earth and the zeon forces and this is some of the best parts of this when they focus on the war as a whole showing both sides (zeon a bit less) as just people fighting for what they believe in (minus the whole nazi
                  ...
government that zeon was kinda turning into) 9/10
characters were my second favorite part everyone felt really unique and different to each other only downside being how sometimes the minor characters can be dropped a bit frau beau obviously being my least favorite victim of this, as shes not explored that much through the show after the first few episodes and every now and then to show up to do her thing and leave. 8.5/10
animation was obviously the biggest hitch in this show being made in '79 i knew it would be bad yet other than the overuse of specificic animations especially with the rx-78. yet it was great for the time which is why instead of a 3 or even a 2 im giving it a 6/10.
im not gonna go indepth on the music of this series as its not what i watch for but for what its worth i thought it was pretty good but needing a bit more selection.
now for my least favorite part of this the run time, this show is really good at its beginning, good at some parts of the middle and amazing at the end. some parts being how the middle kinda turns into a monster of the week show and it really messed me up when i was hoping for more exploration of the world and its characters and id say instead of 42 episodes i would have much rathered a 25-30 episode run as some of that middle  really lowered my rating of this show.
now for the final reveal i would give this an 8.75/10 compared to nowadays i would give this a 6/10 and back then a 9.5/10."
Romantic Killer,Wrosgar,"The short of it for why I stopped watching, is the main premise of the show gave it a quirky start, but became overbearing to the point that it was no longer interesting.

Premise is girl who is enjoying her personal life with games, chocolate and spending time with her pet cat, gets ""chosen"" by a magical being to lose her favourite things in favor of finding romance possibilities with multiple real world guys. Main character is avidly against this being forced upon her and fights against whatever the magical character concocts and the execution of the show itself is a good one! But as I
                  ...
kept watching more, the quirk of the magical character becomes overbearing and overly contrived. Setting up nonsensical cliched happenstance moments, seemingly brainwashing characters into existence to fit tropes, and loses it's magic very quickly with it's reliance on ""magic"".

For me, there was clearly a point in episode 3 or 4 where they could have let off the gas on the contrived magicalness forcing unrealistic scenarios onto the characters and let things play out more naturally with nudging here and there. But nope, it keeps forcing things to an extreme degree where the show was no longer enjoyable and became no longer worth the watch. Too bad, because the shows execution, characters & dialogue were all done well enough that I could have liked the show if it wasn't for the overbearing magical ""happenstance""!"
Shinreigari,XXzz48,"PS Ratings and rating ruin both enlightenment and enjoyment you are otherwise able to gather from art.

Oh, buckle up folks, because we're about to dive into the ghostly world of ""Shinreigari""! Now, I have to warn you, this anime is so hauntingly good, it might just make your funny bone rattle with laughter. So grab your ectoplasmic popcorn and let's get this review started!

First things first, this anime has more twists and turns than a haunted mansion's staircase. You think you know what's going on? Think again! ""Shinreigari"" will have you scratching your head like a ghost trying to remember how they died. But fear
                  ...
not, because the confusion is part of the charm. It's like a ghostly scavenger hunt, trying to piece together the puzzle of the afterlife while not spilling your popcorn in the process.

Now, let's talk about the characters. They're so well-developed, they could give Casper a run for his money. The protagonist, let's call him ""Spooky McSleuth,"" is a detective with a sixth sense for the supernatural. He's got more spirit than a haunted Ouija board and more wit than a ghostly stand-up comedian. And boy, do the ghosts love to mess with him! It's like they're auditioning for a role in a ghostly sitcom.

Speaking of ghosts, this anime has got a whole spectral buffet of them. We've got your classic vengeful spirits, your mischievous poltergeists, and even a few friendly Caspers thrown in for good measure. It's like a ghost convention in there, and they're all vying for the title of ""Scariest Specter."" But don't worry, they're not that scary. I mean, they're no match for your average Scooby-Doo episode. Jinkies!

Now, let's not forget the animation. It's so beautifully done, it's like a ghostly dance of colors and shadows. The art style is hauntingly gorgeous, with every ghostly detail meticulously crafted. It's like the animators dipped their brushes in ectoplasm and painted a masterpiece. The attention to detail is so impressive, it's like they summoned the spirits of Van Gogh and Picasso to lend a ghostly hand.

But let's not get too serious here, folks. We're talking about an anime that's as funny as a ghostly prank gone wrong. The jokes and puns are so cleverly woven into the storyline, it's like they were ghostwritten by a comedy genius. You'll be chuckling like a ghostly chain rattling in no time. Just be careful not to wake any sleeping spirits with your laughter!

In conclusion, ""Shinreigari"" is a ghostly delight that will have you laughing, scratching your head, and reaching for the popcorn all at once. It's a rollercoaster ride through the afterlife, filled with witty humor and supernatural shenanigans. So, if you're ready to have your funny bone tickled by some ghostly hilarity, then this anime is a must-watch. Just be prepared for a paranormal adventure that will leave you wanting more. Happy haunting, my fellow anime enthusiasts!"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,argy97,"Plot: (8/10)
2 Brothers get into an accident wich leaves their bodies in a bad state, they later join the army and become alchemists in order to get them back fighting many strong opponents in the way and making many friends. thats the synopsis as an idea it sounds ok but its execution is great

Animation: (7/10)
It has a good animation it still holds even to this day but compared to the new anime it might seem a bit old

Villains: (4/10)
The villains do stupid decision after stupid decision, replace them with any villain in shonen and they would have won in the end i am not talking
                  ...
about strength or fights and staff i am talking about planning they had a ""perfect plan"" that was full of holes and ended up failing because of their incompitance its not that the heroes are so smart they figured out a way to beat them its that they did almost nothing to stop them.

Characters: (8/10)
Most characters are very likeable even some of the villains the only problem i could find are the designs i am not a fan of them but they are ok

Ending: (7/10)
Making a good ending is hard and compared to other anime and manga endings it might be one of the best endings but it left many questions but its more personal i would want to see more on what happens after that many characters got their endings but the protagonists didnt or at least thats what i think

Enjoyability: (7/10)
Its one of the most enjoyable series out there but its not as enjoyable as the big 3 or the popular series i cant say what exactly is missing

Overall: (8/10)
if you are looking for the best anime you will not find it here, if you want a top tier fighting shonen its not it, if you want the best villains again its not fmab but if you want a good story with a nice plot and and a decent ending then its a story for you"
Zom 100: Zombie ni Naru made ni Shitai 100 no Koto,KaburKert,"Visuals are fine. Yet i dont know how to feel about budget since half of the op is previous ep. It can be good, maybe.
 I realy did not laugh at the comedy nor i get sad about anything. It has the feeling of an OP MC... which can be good if they lean on comedy or epic part. But this anime is trying to be comedy which is not a good choice for a zombie anime. How are they going to make an 12 ep around zombie comedy?
 I don't know the manga if it has one nor idc.(not a big manga reader.) I
                  ...
cannot see in top 100 but if you like a mid comedy anime go for it i guess.
 It couldn't make me feel a lot but i didnt get bored... that much."
To Heart: Remember My Memories Specials,Otakudachinya,"half of this was just fanservice … i don't even remember what the plot to this anime even really was at all however i can remember that their was a bunch of anime girls fighting with a ton of shots of their panties and that was basically it.

There isn't much else for me to say.. the episodes were only short and their is only like 7 episodes but if your into anime girls moaning and having their skirts blown upwards from the wind revealing their panties i guess this would be perfect for you and you could probably get through it all within 30 minutes
                  ...
but be cautious of shots of panties if you decide to watch !"
Itai no wa Iya nanode Bougyoryoku ni Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu. 2,baxa,"""BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense. Season 2""

Genre- Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Game, Comedy.

The 2nd season of Bofuri starts right where it left us. From introducing many new levels to different and much stronger bosses, this 2nd season brings you even more action and thrill in the world of ""New World Online"" and particularly in the ""Maple Tree"" guild.

While the main story sticks to its basics and delivers the punches we are looking for, this season lacks the excrement the prologue had in terms of an overpowered MC, a surprise element like the ones we used to see in
                  ...
PvP battles, and also a top tier animation that could wow the life out of you. With the primary focus, this time being guild competitions and the progress of all the characters and not only the MC, the 2nd season fails massively in comparison to the first season. It has a good storyline if you want to witness only action and a game-type environment, but if you wanted to go back to this anime for OP Maple that made us laugh, jump around in excitement, and hooked on to the chair, I would say it's better to skip this season as it has nothing of the sort which can captivate you as it did before.

And to add to all of this, the 2nd season also fails us in terms of animation and action sequences as it lowers them by almost 10 folds and you can't help but wonder when will all this be over. And while it may have a solid storyline for future seasons, I can say that if this is what's getting delivered, it is better to probably skip it.

This anime is recommended for every ""ACTION"" anime lover."
ChroNoiR Episode.0,Detective_Chi,"Gorgeous! Breathtaking, I thought I had gone to heaven

If you know Kanae, Kuzuha and their lore in their unit ChroNoiR, this short animation highlights portions that we already know with new infomation.
A-1 Pictures outdid themselves with the gorgeous animation capturing the beauty of Kanae and Lagusa/Sasha.

Kanae and Kuzuha's voice acting was perfect!! Perfectly encapsulating their roles as themselves without feeling forced or inconsistent, despite their first time being voice actors for an anime/animation.

The soundtrack was heavenly with multiple bgms and the instrumental of Geminids and the ed, ""Wanderers"" composed by Dios and sung by Kanae and Kuxuha themselves was a blessing on the ears.

Highly recomend!!"
Kimitachi wa Dou Ikiru ka,Sigsig,"The movie feels like a series of short stories forcibly strung together with unrelated characters. I expect that there is some abstract meaning to it, but it was not obvious to me as an average moviegoer. The protagonist, while not very vocal, is unusually perceptive and somehow recognizes those seemingly unrelated characters and matches them with actual people he knows, which always turn out to be correct guesses. In the abrupt end, I was filled with more questions about the motivations and aftermath of what happened to the sub characters. Unlike the other Ghibli films that teaches a moral or converses a message, I didn't
                  ...
get what was supposed to be the point of this movie. 

That said, the animation and sound are all on point which makes this a pleasing experience for the eyes and ears, but not quite brain. I would recommend it if you love Ghibli films and have 2 hours to kill."
Hataraku Maou-sama!! 2nd Season,revankutaro,"Devil is a Part-Timer itself is an okay story. I'm no active manga reader so I can't talk about whether or not the anime adaptation is any better or any worse. It's a comedy/fantasy with a hint of slice-of-life and surprisingly kind-of-but-maybe-not-so-accurate biblical accuracy that made me genuinely curious enough to research the mythological references on multiple occasions. That being said, the story is simple and easy-to-follow, allowing a casual viewing experience and rewarding you for not taking it so seriously.

The characters are funny and the demon dudes are quick to retort with simple-but-effective comebacks to make the angel gals blush up and pout. It's
                  ...
not knee-slapper comedy, but it's certainly given me a few occasional wide smiles.

 I do much prefer the current studio's (3Hz) art style over the previous (White Fox's) despite it being just as simple and generic; it's softer and more pleasant to look at, and the girls got a very cute glow-up.

And the negatives...
The characters have abysmal growth. After two full seasons and some change, they might act slightly different around one another but there's still that looming sense of ""you're my mortal enemy and I don't entirely trust you."" Emilia is the biggest example of this. You get this feeling every episode that she might turn a new leaf and accept Maou as being just a ""good guy"" and even admit feelings despite the strenuous amount of romantic tension forced onto the viewer via Chiho, but it just never happens. It's even more apparent since the beginning of the second season where they're now literally raising a child together, albeit with the help of Shirou and friends. 

And, ah, Chiho. From kind-of-cute side character to Mary Sue. She was a useless character in need of saving, but now she's even BETTER! A character with newfound powers who is quick to learn and has innate talent, but is also useless and always in need of saving. I was on the fence about her and was just about to admit I liked her as a character until this season.

Lastly, I want to highlight the biggest issues I have with a lot of shows: consequences. I can understand writers not wanting to throw away or kill-off characters, but it feels wrong for such massive problems to have such little permanent consequences on the group.

TL;DR
The show is fine if you can overlook what I personally think is appallingly slow character growth between the beginning of season two and now. Even so, it's an entertaining watch and I'd even go so far as to say I love it despite its flaws. So I'm not gonna go against recommending it, but I can say with certainty it's one of those shows that has a great first season to hook you in but disappointing sequels if you hold high standards and overhype.

That being said, this is really a review of the second season + the three episodes we've seen so far, so I won't be so quick to judge negatively. It's at least worth a 5/10, but because I still really do love the show, it deserves another point."
Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season,revankutaro,"After watching the first episode I was kind of disappointed to start out with ""prequel"" episodes. I was hoping for a jump straight into Itadori's next adventure with the group but I was *not* expecting the weight of these episodes. 

 The beautifully drawn backgrounds, and the perfect choice of classical music to go along with them. I wasn't head-over-heels for MAPPA after they took over AOT's animation and never really looked too close at anything but the characters, but they've outdone themselves so far with JJK. In stark contrast to Chainsaw Man, I don't think I've noticed a single bad fight scene or the
                  ...
implementation of 3D models that ruin their fluidity. 

And gods, the eyes. They're so pleasant to look at in those close-ups. And the INTRO AND OUTRO. I'm not so into them that I watch them all the way through like I did the first season's, but they're still gorgeous. And again, the classic music is stunning along with their scenes. I don't think I've ever paid so close attention to a scene than when those tracks are playing. Seriously, the animation team should get a bonus check for those Amanai underwater scenes. Ahh, Amanai... 

I don't want to fanboy too hard, so I'll just leave it at that and say that I've not been so excited for the next episode since season one of Shield Hero."
Higeki no Genkyou to Naru Saikyou Gedou Last Boss Joou wa Tami no Tame ni Tsukushimasu.,TheRealAmaz,"Usually, I try to praise any work I see, but unfortunately, this anime is just, bad. There is no arguing about it. 

Animation & Artstyle: 5.5/10
The art style is actually pretty decent, nothing jaw-breaking but it has good details, and I like the character designs, plus the contrast is actually pretty good compared to the pastel colour grading that other otome game anime usually have. But, the animation is pretty bad; The choreography makes the characters stiff, especially in fights, and the cinematography is quite plain as well. 

Sound design & Music: 7.5/10 
The overall sound design is rather bland, but the soundtrack is actually
                  ...
quite good. 

Story & Characters: 2/10
I don't know about the original novel, but I have to say, the writing in this anime is god-awful, just terrible. The plot itself is unoriginal. The characters are extremely shallow and often do things that shouldn't be possible at all. It's like the author has never met and interacted with real human beings, and only knows them through anime."
Isekai Shokudou 2,Gameboon,"This is a full series review, meaning my opinion on both season 1 and 2 are intertwined in this review. This is because I watched them one after another and because there is not enough of difference between the seasons to warrant a separate review.

First of all, let me say that if you’re looking for a relaxed, cozy slice-of-life series with an emphasis on food you’re in the right place with Isekai Shokudou. It’s all very lighthearted and a good way to forget your worries for a bit. I personally also feel the isekai aspect adds some spice into the mix and makes the character
                  ...
responses and interactions all the more interesting. 

Isekai shokudou starts out with a very strict dish-of-the-week format, and the various types of scenes that you will encounter in each episode follow their set schedule tightly. But just as it starts getting repetitive, somewhere around the half of season 1, this tight format becomes looser and looser while still adhering to the general idea. In essence, the dish-of-the-week format stays but how it is presented varies considerably. Near the end of the series it becomes a lot more freeform and you will get to see more of the fantasy world and not only stuff that happens in the restaurant.

There are always two main points that make up the episode – a combination of dish and character. Often, this means a new dish being served to a new patron. You get to experience some of their story and background and what led them to the restaurant. Because characters are from various nations in the fantasy world, their circumstances differ quite a bit. Some episodes expand upon characters you already know, adding to their story while still managing to introduce a new menu item. Of course, every patron is always pleasantly surprised by their meal. In addition, patrons interacting with one another is a pillar of the series as well and makes the world feel more alive.

Each episode has two halves, centering around a dish each. So even though there are only twelve episodes per season, you actually get 24 stories per season. I feel they managed to present a lot of joy and personality in such a short timeframe. There is no filler or unnecessary clutter.

The visual character designs are quite good and distinctive without being overly detailed or messy. The art and animation and general are fine and easy on the eyes. But where the visuals really shine is in the brief close-up shots of food. Those shots are some of the best views I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching in anime. It really makes me want to eat those dishes myself.

I have little to remark on the sound effects, they did what they needed to do. But the music was calm, cozy and iconic. What I mean by iconic is that whenever a particular type of scene takes place, the accompanying music is there to enhance and reinforce it.

The voice acting was generally very good, with many well-known VAs making an appearance.

In the end, Isekai Shokudou was a particularly enjoyable and memorable watch for me. I might even seek out the light novel source material because the anime was so much fun. In the end, it was the same thing happening over and over again with a “wow, this sure is delicious” response to the food, but it didn’t detract from my enjoyment at all. And if you’re looking for some cozy food and fantasy stories, I can hardly imagine anything better."
Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu,Malighos,"Garbage shit aimed at pedophiles.
The protagonist is an actual pedophile.
The story enables his pedophilic behaviour as he grooms little girls to fuck later on.
This show is absolutely disgusting.

If you like that shit or shit like Cuties, you will probably like this garbage.
If you hate actual pedophiles, skip this.

""but but he redeems himself..."" No he fuckin doesn't. He is a grooming pedophile from start to finish. The overall story is garbage and predictable, the characters are insufferable. The only thing this series has going for it are it's visuals, but in todays market they are nothing special."
Zom 100: Zombie ni Naru made ni Shitai 100 no Koto,CripplingBigSad,"At the heart of this goofy, action-packed anime, lies a key message worth remembering long after the series ends:
""Live every day like it's your last""

Zom 100 perfectly tackles one of the most relevant issues impacting the lives of too many young adults. If you have ever worked yourself to the brink of exhaustion for some faraway goal you've long since forgotten, sold your happiness for hollow material gain, become too obsessed with maintaining the perfect life to actually enjoy it, or cut ties with every important person in your life to make room for ""the grind"", then this anime will speak to you on a
                  ...
fundamental emotional level previously not thought possible. Zom 100 is the perfect antidote to the drudge of everyday life. It teaches you to be defiantly upbeat when you have no right to be, to enjoy moments both big and small, to live fulfilled without any regrets, and above all, to take care of yourself.

Because hey, if the MC can find happiness during a zombie apocalypse, then why can't you?

Animation:
Zom 100 simply has no right being this gorgeous. The artstyle is unusually vibrant and expressive for a zombie anime, but adoringly fitting given the show's entire ""party at the end of the world"" theme. The colors and camera angles of each frame feels carefully crafted and thought-out to convey a particular feeling, like the very best of any critically acclaimed masterpiece. Shots are fluid, and lighting is bright. Oh, and I almost forgot. This show has some of the best character designs I have ever seen, period. Overall, Zom 100's animation is bursting with style and attitude, an absolute treat to the eyes.

Music:
Absolutely perfect. It's not something I can quite explain, but the anime's score somehow manages to capture the emotions of each scene so well. The triumphant tracks make epic moments hit twice as hard, while the OP and ED really manages to convey that rebelliously upbeat vibe the anime has got going.

Voice acting:
Whoever voices the MC should be given a raise. Every line felt real and visceral, like it came straight from the character. Nothing much else to add, but the voice acting across the board is great.

Really, I've got zero complaints"
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,NoahJPG,"THIS IS THE BEST PIECE OF FICTION I'VE EVER SEEN. From start to finish it's a rollercoaster of emotions without a single boring episode. If I could pick one movie or show to watch for the first time again this would be the one, the ending is so sad and so beautiful, not to mention the amazing art style, animation and character design, it fits the cyberpunk theme extremely well. This masterpiece definitely deserved Anime of the Year.

If your like me and can't watch anime that has a slow start, this is highly recommended, It gets right into the action in the very first episode,
                  ...
and continues to keep that throughout every episode."
Tengoku Daimakyou,Elixio,"Rarely has an anime touched and moved me as deeply as Tengoku Daimakyou.

The world depicted in the adaptation is brutally real and harsh. The world-building is close to perfection and all the adventures of the main characters are genuinely touching to watch.

This is how I could speak of this anime, a very, very hard reality. If you don't have the heart for it, this anime is not for you.

Tengoku Daimakyou clearly walks in some of Evangelion's footsteps in certain respects.

The animation is finely tuned and the execution is sublime.

The style, though outside certain modern animation standards, is flawless. It fits perfectly with the theme and
                  ...
perfectly describes the sentiment of the series.

The opening, as I couldn't overlook the opening which has that certain something exceptional that makes it work perfectly with the anime.

However, I want to re-emphasize that the world of Tengoku Daimakyou is far from ours, but the human condition and how individuals would act in this world is strikingly real to the point of sometimes being very scary/traumatizing, in my case. Just for that, the anime deserves to be watched.

Tengoku Daimakyou deserves to be watched by all people who like to have their hearts boken and who wish to experience an adventure in a post-apocalyptic world crying out in reality and realism."
Hanma Baki: Son of Ogre 2nd Season,No-LifeKing_26,"As the newer Baki seasons released they have been become more and more of series told almost entirely through a narrative. What do I mean by this? With every fight or a particular event there is always an narrator over explaining it. Where this move came from (which isn't always bad), why he did this/that happen, what are we viewing, etc and this happens constantly. And honestly it just gets played out. The fights scenes are really mediocre and you always wonder if Yujiro is going to do something. I watched this because I watched the other Baki series and from a true anime fan's
                  ...
perspective, you are not missing anything. The ending was very anticlimactic and now it's more of a, ""what will they think of next"", an alien from space?"
Biohazard: Death Island,captainkid-tr,"Firstly Sorry for my bad English :))
Resident Evil, also known as the Biohazard series, has a very special place for me. I love all the characters, especially Leon (I love everyone, including Ashley, who has cancer in Re 4' game) and when I saw the trailer of this movie, I was already in the mood saying ""Oh, let's watch it right away"". This movie has Resident Evil Avengers, almost all the popular characters. Leon, Chris, Clarie, Jill and Rebecca what more. Even if these characters only shoot at the zombies, they have set up such a cast that we can watch for 1.5 hours without
                  ...
getting bored. (This time, not just Leon, everyone is hooked to John Wick, they go to the pistol Headshot :D Normally, Resident Evil animated movies, dont talk about previous games and movies. ""He always writes scenarios by underlaying them as if he is playing to the new audience. However, this is not the first time they have done this in this movie, and this decision was very good. It was nice to talk about the old ones and refer to them. I finished resident evil 2-7 games. Film."" We understand that after the 5th Game, becasuse Chris saying ""Wesker had brainwashed Jill""  even from what Chris said about Piers Nivans, after the 6th Game, it felt nostalgic for him to accept the past and talk about it. Even I, who are just plain viewers without research, understood the time. Likewise, from the conversation between Maria Gomez in Leon, referring to the previous movie, Resident Evil Vendetta, which was reviewed on our site, we can accept that movie and understand that this production took place after that.

I realize it's a long introduction because I really like the series. The animations look great in this movie, too. Not a Final Fantasy quality, but still great for today's conditions. (Let me point out that the mouth and eyes are sometimes ridiculous and glaring) The voice-over staff is amazing. I watched English, and I recommend English to you rather than Japanese. You praise it so much, but you will say why did you give 8? The main villain of the movie is a mediocre one, the animations I've said stand out from place to place. There are no music patterns. And I think the biggest minus is that they had to put some tension parts. It's been a lot of action. I think the action scenes are great, but the thriller is a genre that should be in the genes of Resident Evil. but unfortunately it was never in the movie. In addition, the film is very short, only 1.5 hours long. So I don't want to talk much about the story. If you remove the action parts, there is a little story left. In terms of the story of the movie, I think it starts out very strikingly, but then it becomes mediocre. That's why I think you will watch a very enjoyable crispy cookie movie with 8 points. (By the way, it's sad that they didn't add a scary voiceover called RESSİİNTT EVİLLL DEATHH ISLANDDD at the beginning of the movie :D )

Let me not go without praise, I liked the last Boss fight too much. Take down the big Boss by using the guns, bullets and other gear around. Just like in their games. Especially in the Resident Evil 6 game, we were getting into such crowded boss fights, it gave me nostalgia. Nobody likes it, but I would like to see Wesker's Son Jake Muller in RE 6' in game.I I wish I see him next animation movie But they literally wiped out the character. After Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, which was a big disappointment for me, this movie came as a medicine, I hope you enjoy watching it. Don't expect too much, but you will have an enjoyable 1.5 hours from me. I hope the film draws a graph that climbs upwards by throwing off the low scores it has now received. So we keep seeing movies like this. Otherwise, we're left with the infamous Resident Evil series and movies shot by real people. Imdb series with 2.5-3 points, they are making the movie, they are not ashamed, they call it REsident Evil. Shame on the brand. So let's value and upgrade these animations. See yha in ; Quality animes, Charisma like Leon, Muscular like Chris, beautiful like Jill, smart like Rebecca, meddling like Claria, but a survivor :D"
Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta,L3_MufF1n,"I’ve seen a fair share of romance anime and generally content centered around some kind of gimmick. The usage of a gimmick is fine as a sort of introduction or preliminary tool to lead to character interaction and maybe develop a unique relationship. This anime chooses something unique but it feels like it’s doomed to destroy any potential in the story by how stupid it is, the female lead constantly finds a way to forget her glasses even with extreme visual impairment. Thus, leading the involvement of the main character into her life, using it as a stepping stone to get closer with his crush.
                  ...


Every scenario or time that she forgets her glasses seems so fake, even for an anime this seems entirely unbelievable. Playing into a sort of clip like pacing with little events with the MC just helping her is so random, no one just forgets their glasses everyday. Furthermore, it’s just like seeing the same thing all the time and gets extremely repetitive on top of my prior gripes.

On the other hand the art design, animation and everything is beautiful which deserves props for sure, as that’s the only thing that really kept me watching past like the first two episodes. The eyes, hair and everything always looks very on point with fluidity and a natural feel. This kind of flair is great and all except when it feels like it’s weighing down the pace of the story, there are an excessive amount of establishing shots thrown at you constantly which make the start or transitions within episodes feel sluggish. Why do I need to watch random people and the MC walking to school or through the hallway and why does it last so long? I feel myself also getting mad at the unusual perspectives they use in some of these scenes, it feels extremely alien to other anime and the way they use them feels off putting. 

Beyond these issues the MC is just a simp for his crush which seems odd because he basically just becomes her slave entirely to progress a relationship and ignore all her red flags like her awful awareness and memory. It just removes the grounding from the plot when I’m baffled by the wacky and random nature of their actions rooted in something that I simply can’t imagine happening at all, I’m talking about everything in relation to the forgetting glasses gimmick.

The story is mildly wholesome but lacks realism and pacing or anything that really goes anywhere, entertainment-wise there’s much better but it’s okay and the art style is great but feels like it’s controlling the narrative’s flow negatively and the characters feel extremely artificial and unrelatable."
The First Slam Dunk,onespankman,"The First Slam Dunk does something absolutely genius, it adapts the ending of its manga as a standalone film. I didn’t know that going in, nor did I know anything about the manga aside from who wrote it. But I do know the conventions of sports anime filmmaking, and the way this film subverts them is downright genius.

One such convention is to put you inside the protagonists’ heads. This fills time without requiring complex animation, and informs the viewer as to the character’s plan and mental state. It is not a technique without merit, but is often used excessively in TV productions as to break
                  ...
off tension and slow pacing.

Slam Dunk avoids this at points, in absence of internal monologue, communicating the characters’ intentions by a shared glance or via carefully directed animation. Essentially, the Basketball is allowed to speak for itself.

This has a unique effect. Since we don’t always know the protagonists’ intentions, every fake out and feint catches the viewer off guard, whichever team performs it. This effectively doubles the tension that otherwise would have existed, and it's only possible due to the film’s restrained internal monologuing.

Occasionally, when a character is stuck in their own head or planning something, we do get an internal monologue, but that is always broken off by an opponent move or a quick execution of said plan, leaving no room for tension to break.

Another cinematic convention which typically holds back sports anime, even great ones, is reaction shots. A bad reaction shot takes the focus off the players, centering attention on the sidelines rather than the action. This can entirely sever the tension of a scene, and does in many TV productions looking to fill time. 

They aren’t entirely useless though. A well placed reaction shot can contextualize action through the thoughts and emotions of the crowd, coaches, and sidelined players. They can enhance a narrative if interjected carefully. 

The scriptwriter and storyboard artists here understood exactly how to use a reaction shot, enhancing the atmosphere and stakes around the match while not meaningfully interrupting the action. Longer reactions are entirely reserved to breaks in play, and those in the action aren’t intrusive.

A good reaction shot is often only one second and a single word long, this film gets that, and only interjects such brief cuts.

A similar technique TV productions rely on to fill time is cuts to backstory, which typically involve less complex animation than the sports at center stage. In TV productions these all too often come at the height of tension, rendering null all of the emotion built during a match.

Slam Dunk too improves on this technique, opening on the protagonist’s backstory, then intercutting between the finals match and the core cast’s backstories, splitting time about evenly between the two.

By defining the emotional stakes as the match progresses and interlacing explicit characterization with displays of the characters’ playstyles, the cuts here add tension rather than break it. They too make the film feel like one cohesive narrative, explicitly connecting the character’s arcs to the sport. The viewer comes to understand what the match means to the players as it progresses. 

The quality of the scene-to-scene editing too extends to the shot-to-shot editing, which perfectly conveys the dynamics on court at any given moment, and ties the animation together immaculately.

That animation is fantastic. Anime has been trying for decades to seamlessly blend 3D models with 2D backgrounds, and there are moments here that execute on that perfectly. It is not the first anime production to seamlessly blend 2D and 3D, Studio Ghibli accomplished that back in 2004, but it is the closest I’ve seen an anime get to achieving it with 3D character models.

Those models are perfectly lit, and incorporate beautiful line art that somewhat replicate the manga’s style.

There is some top tier 2D sakuga on display here as well. That walk out where the 5 core players are slowly penciled in is a perfect introduction to the team and the central match.

The closing moments of that match comprise one of the most impressive sequences in anime history. All sound falls away and we’re left only with cinematic storytelling and the emotions of the characters. The characters’ line art stretches out behind them as they move. It replicates the mental state of the players, exhausted, losing control, but locked in on one goal. It replicates a flow state in the invested viewer.

Perhaps Slam Dunk’s most impressive subversion of sports anime convention is that every single point scored is shown. It is standard (and often necessary) for TV productions to cut across large swaths of scoring, only showing swings in momentum or morale. This film isn't bound by the production limitations that necessitate that, and can thus portray its content more convincingly than any other sports anime.

No room is left for the viewer to question the realism of a comeback because they see all of it play out. Frequent cuts to the scoreboard and clock too aid the viewer in understanding the match clearly as it unfolds.

Slam Dunk again bucks convention by not explaining any of the sport’s rules. The first few episodes of most sports anime typically involve a description of the sport’s rules, for obvious reasons. Slam Dunk brilliantly sidesteps this, never explaining a single rule, but always keeping the lay viewer informed through cinematic storytelling.

I’m kind of a casual NBA fan, I follow NBA news a bit, and even tune in for finals matches sometimes, but I’m not well versed in the rulebook. Despite that shallow knowledge, I was never once confused during this movie. I imagine someone even less knowledgeable than me would have inferred the relevant rules.

The film’s narrative is more impactful for first time viewers in an important way, knowledge of the outcome. Viewers aware of the plot of Slam Dunk, or even what part of the manga this adapts will already know who wins. Almost all sports anime are predictable in this department, that’s just how single elimination tournaments and long-form narratives tend to interact.

Slam Dunk doesn’t have this problem though. The viewer is only shown one match, over the course of which emotional stakes are built, but wider plot implications are never covered. We aren’t told if this is their last shot, or even what year some of the players are in. Because the viewer is not fully aware of the stakes, and this is a standalone film, the outcome of the match is not clear from the start. That contributes to tension, and it's something many beefier narratives, including the one on which this film is based, can’t replicate.

The soundtrack is phenomenal, incorporating rock and electronic elements to generate hype I haven't felt in years, maybe ever. It's the icing on the hype cake, and it propels the narrative to insane emotional heights.

This movie accomplishes in 2 hours what takes most sports manga 300 chapters. What other sports anime do to save money or time, this film does deliberately to enhance the narrative. 

The First Slam Dunk is the greatest sports anime I’ve ever seen. It will be the impossible standard to which I compare all sports anime for the foreseeable future.

No other anime has made my heart race like this one. It’s an anime AED.

Or, put another way, it’s a masterpiece."
Ping Pong the Animation,TinoTheThortino,"This show is not for everyone so, whoever wants to approach it, is advised.
""Ping Pong the Animation"" is an unusual anime, mainly based on the characters' development and their bond with this sport.

ANIMATION (10) - it is literally written in the title of the show so.. animations are extraordinarly-well drawn (surely there were lots of studies about real ping-pong players playing): very smooth and fluid, they give you that feeling of watching a real professional ping-pong game.
Even if sometimes they do look repetitive and weird, especially when lots of people are drawn in the same scene, I felt satisfied overall.

CHARACTERS (9) - another strenght of
                  ...
this anime, as I said before, is the characters' development.
Every single character has its own personal profile and story, shared by the same connection with ping-pong: they interact and share their own life and sport experiences, growing both as people and as players.
Tsukimoto, for example, shows a huge change from a depressed child playing without a purpose, just because he has an innate talent, to a passionate player who finally got a reason to live and loves the sport.

ART (8) - yeah, I know many people criticized it because it looks awful and characters are drawn differently in each frame.
It is not the point of this art style, but I also understand everyone has its own taste.
Personally, I found it very coeherent with the show: it followed the manga's guidelines and, even if it looks outdated, it's actually in line with the historical period it is set in.
Something more modern would be unpleasant and completely out of the time, so I think using the same art style from the 1996 was a smart choice.

SOUND (8-) - honestly, I had good vibes listening to soundtracks, especially during ping-pong matches. So, I found them fine overall.

PLOT (7) - nothing outstanding: people just keep playing ping-pong 'till the end.
The events happening during the show are bland, only made for backgrounding every dialogue and that's it.
I'm not saying it is bad, but not even great.

OVERALL (9) - if I hadn't trusted the other users evalutations, I wouldn't have given this anime a try: initially, the art style kept me away because of its quirkyness but, in the end, I learned to not judge a book by its cover.
I found ""Ping Pong the Animation"" a really interesting show: very careful about details, treating the sport topic in a unique way.

I recommend you give it at least a try.
For me, it was definitely worth watching."
Hanma Baki: Son of Ogre 2nd Season,SAT_KUMAR,"Here comes another installment of Baki, a series known for its intense gore and wtf moments. If you've been a fan of the characters so far, you might somewhat enjoy this season too, but there's a problem.

The issue lies in the fact that this season contributes nothing significant to the actual storyline of the Baki universe. We've already had three seasons of Baki (excluding the older Grappler Baki seasons), all building up to the legendary fight between father and son. The last season, in particular, set the stage for this epic showdown, with Baki defeating the second-strongest man on the planet, leaving only Yujiro in
                  ...
his way. Consequently, this new season feels more like a filler arc, as it doesn't impact the main storyline.

The main focus of this season is on a prehistoric man named Pickle, who mysteriously survived being frozen in ice while battling a dinosaur (quite the Captain America move right there!). He reemerges in the modern world, and surprisingly, he's already stronger than most well-established characters in the series. This becomes problematic as this season doesn't treat these beloved characters with the respect they deserve, often making them act goofier without reason. It's like after three seasons, suddenly all the characters become less intelligent, which is kinda disappointing. This is more apparent in some scenes, like the one where every character goes to the facility where Pickle is kept just to see how strong he is or the scene where Retsu starts throwing random punches at Pickle, completely forgetting his so-called 4000-year-old fighting style.

When it comes to fights, they are undeniably gory, even more so than the previous season. You've got a severed leg, hand, and mouth (the result of the most intimate kiss in anime history). Given that Pickle considers opponents as mere food, such brutality is expected. Other than that the CGI is somewhat less I guess, although don't expect continuous fight frames as the narrator along with Tokugawa and a weird scientist will constantly butt in with their explanations. Even then, I do feel there is somewhat of an improvement in this aspect this season, as last season felt more like PowerPoint slides in motion. So I would give a point to that.


Overall, it's a passable season. We all know why we're here – we want to see Yujiro vs. Baki, and unfortunately, you won't get that this season. There are some cool fights scattered throughout, but it mostly feels like a filler season at best. If you're a die-hard fan of Baki fights, you might enjoy it, but otherwise, it's a skippable season where you won't miss anything crucial to the main storyline."
